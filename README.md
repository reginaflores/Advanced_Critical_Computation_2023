## Course Description

Advanced Critical Computation is a continuation of the principles and techniques taught in Critical Computation. Students will expand their conceptual and technical skills in the pursuit of mastering code and procedurality as a tool for creative, critical, and aesthetic exploration and expression. Topics will include algorithms, object-oriented programming, and the historical and cultural context of software in art and design. We will focus on building more complex systems and exploring specific creative applications of code. Students will work with p5.js and Javascript to produce five creative projects throughout the semester.

## Assignment Submisions

You will use this [Glitch template](https://glitch.com/~code-portfolio-template) as a starting point to build your CC portfolio. Focus on populating the web pages with thoughtful written descriptions and design documentations. Towards the end of the semester you will learn the HTML / CSS skills required to further customize the website.
