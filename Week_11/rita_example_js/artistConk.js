let artistConk = "The artist’s conk (Ganoderma applanatum) is very common in these parts, especially in Maine, growing on sugar maples and other hardwoods. They are best known for their use as artist’s canvases, hence the name. People have been etching beautiful designs into their pale white undersides for centuries. According to Tom Volk (University of Wisconsin), this species and/or its close relatives can be found on every continent (except Antarctica).Artist’s conks are shelf fungi - a type of mushroom that grows horizontally out of tree trunks, like a shelf (they are called bracket fungi for the same reason). While there are a large number of different shelf fungi artist’s conks are fairly distinctive in that they are large and somewhat flat, the color of their topsides (caps) ranges from brown to pale gray and are concentrically ringed or furrowed.The underside of an artist’s conk is white and bruises easily.That underside is what makes artist’s conks such a great medium for art. You can etch designs into the pores and they will last for years. Shelf fungi like the artist’s conks are in a group of mushrooms called polypores — because of the many pores that cover the underside of the cap. If you look at the underside of a typical mushroom — for example that baby bella you just bought at the grocery, you’ll see gills, these are where the spores are produced in many mushrooms. Instead of having spore-producing gills polypores have many pores lined with spore-producing cells called basidia. Those are the white pores that you scratch away to produce your work of art.Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the English language including 'to mushroom' or 'mushrooming' (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and 'to pop up like a mushroom' (to appear unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids. The cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size . Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like Parasola plicatilis (formerly Coprinus plicatlis), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.[13] The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse. They 'mushroom' to full size.Not all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.Though mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of Armillaria solidipes (formerly known as Armillaria ostoyae) in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated 2,200 acres (8.9 km2).[15] Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.[16]"
